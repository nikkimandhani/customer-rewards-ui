#CustomerReward

#Problem Statement:
A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.

A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent over $50 in each transaction
(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).

Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total.


#Assumption:

It is located in src/server/customer_rewards.json

# Steps to Execute:
1. npm install
2. npm run server
3. npm run start
Navigate to localhost:3006/ it will load table which display data about customer reward points.
